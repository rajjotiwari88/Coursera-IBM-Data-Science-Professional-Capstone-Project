    "Choosing a location for your restaurant is one of just a few keys to profitability. Parking and accessibility can be as crucial to a restaurant's success as great food and service. There is a famous saying in real estate that also holds true for restaurants: \"You make your money when you buy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A restaurant's location influences many aspects of your operation, including the menu and style of the dining room. If you already have a certain restaurant location in mind, don’t get too attached until you know if it has all the right requirements for a successful restaurant."

    "The classic real estate saying “location, location, location” applies to choosing a site for a new restaurant. Location influences the success or failure of a restaurant in a host of ways, from attracting enough initial customer interest to being convenient to visit. But the restaurant’s location is also interrelated to other factors, some of which are changeable, while others are not. A great restaurant location, for instance, must have an affordable rent, or it does not matter how much foot traffic the site receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, many restaurants fail within three years, and a lack of planning contributes to this hard reality. Sometimes, restaurants that would be otherwise successful go out of business because they are inaccessible or unknown to their potential customers. As might be expected, visibility and accessibility have a disproportionate effect on new restaurants that are not established yet with a core of loyal customers. Before signing a lease, restaurant owners should not get carried away with any one location until they have done their homework on the location. You must be certain that when you choose a location you are using your head as much as your heart."

    "# 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To train and test the data, this project will use linear and logistic regression machine learning methods.Namely, linear regression will be used in an attempt to predict the number of \"likes\" a new restaurant in this region will have. We will utilize the Sci-Kit Learn Package to run the model. We can also utilize logisitc regression as a classification method rather than direct prediction of the number of likes. Since the number of \"likes\" can be binned into different categories based on different percentile bins, it is also potentiallly possible to see which range of \"likes\" a new restaurant in this region will have. Since the \"likes\" are binned into multiple (more than 2) categories, the type of logistic regression will be multinomial. Additionally, although the ranges are indeed discrete categories, they are also ordinal in nature. Therefore, the logistic regression will need to be specified as being both multinomial and ordinal. This can be done through the Sci-Kit Learn Package as well."

    "we are assumming that likes are a good proxy for how well a new restaurant will do in terms of brand, image and by extension how well\n",
    "the restaurant will perform business-wise. Whether or not these assumptions hold up in a real-life scenario is up for discussion, but \n",

    "percentile of likes) were 42%, 43%, and 60%. Therefore, the model is better at predicting if a restaurant will fall into the best or worst\n",
