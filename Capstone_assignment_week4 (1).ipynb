    "Choosing a location for your restaurant is one of just a few keys to profitability. Parking and accessibility can be as crucial to a restaurant's success as great food and service. There is a famous saying in real estate that also holds true for restaurants: \"You make your money when you buy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A restaurant's location influences many aspects of your operation, including the menu and style of the dining room. If you already have a certain restaurant location in mind, don’t get too attached until you know if it has all the right requirements for a successful restaurant."

    "The classic real estate saying “location, location, location” applies to choosing a site for a new restaurant. Location influences the success or failure of a restaurant in a host of ways, from attracting enough initial customer interest to being convenient to visit. But the restaurant’s location is also interrelated to other factors, some of which are changeable, while others are not. A great restaurant location, for instance, must have an affordable rent, or it does not matter how much foot traffic the site receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, many restaurants fail within three years, and a lack of planning contributes to this hard reality. Sometimes, restaurants that would be otherwise successful go out of business because they are inaccessible or unknown to their potential customers. As might be expected, visibility and accessibility have a disproportionate effect on new restaurants that are not established yet with a core of loyal customers. Before signing a lease, restaurant owners should not get carried away with any one location until they have done their homework on the location. You must be certain that when you choose a location you are using your head as much as your heart."

However, the extraction from the FourSquare API actually obtains venue data so it will include venues other than restaurants such as malls, stores, libraries etc. As such, this means that the data will need to be further cleaned somewhat manually by removing all of the nonrestaurant rows.\n",
    "Once this is complete, we have a shortened by cleaned list to pull \"likes\" data.The \"id\" is an important column as it will allow us to further pull the \"likes\" from the API. We can retreive the \"likes\" based on the restaurant \"id\" and then append it to the data frame. Once this is complete, we finally name the dataframe 'raw_dataset' as it is the most complete compiled form before needing any processing for analysis via machine learning."
